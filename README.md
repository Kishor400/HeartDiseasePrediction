<h3>Logistic Regression Algorithm :</h3>

<p>Logistic regression is a statistical method used for binary classification, which means it is used to predict the probability of an instance belonging to one of two classes. It's named "logistic" because it models the probability using the logistic function, also known as the sigmoid function.</p>
<h3>Why Not Linear Regression :</h3>

<p>Logistic regression is preferred over linear regression for binary classification because it models probabilities using the sigmoid function, constraining output between 0 and 1. Linear regression's unbounded output range, sensitivity to outliers, and assumption of linearity make it less suitable for predicting binary outcomes. Logistic regression addresses these issues and is designed for binary classification tasks.</p>

<p>Formula for linear regression : y = b0 + b1*x</p>
<p>Formula for logistic regression : y = 1 / ( 1 + e^(b0 + b1x) )</p>

<p>The Logistic Regression is only return between 0 to 1.</p>
<p>So The Logistic Regression is used in classification.</p>
